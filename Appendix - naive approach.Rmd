Following the five steps for playing a hand of poker, the naive approach would use a code similar to the following:

```{r naive approach}

#
# Setup
ante   <- 2
cards  <- 1 : 10
bets   <- seq(0, 20, 2)
n_card <- length(cards)
n_bet  <- length(bets )

strategy_A <- array(sample(x = bets, size = n_card, replace = T), 
                    dim = c(n_card, 1), dimnames = list(cards, "Strategy A"))
strategy_B <- array(sample(x = c("Call", "Fold"), n_card * n_bet, T),
                    dim=c(n_card, n_bet, 1), dimnames = list(cards, bets, "Strategy B"))

# Strategies of the two players
print(strategy_A)
print(strategy_B)


#
# Five Steps

# 1. Player A's Bet
card_A   <- sample(cards, 1)
bet_A    <- strategy_A[card_A]

# 2. Player B's Action
card_B   <- sample(cards, 1)
action_B <- strategy_B[card_B, match(x = bet_A, table = bets), 1]

# 3. Pot Size
if (action_B == "Fold") pot <- 2 *  ante
if (action_B == "Call") pot <- 2 * (ante + bet_A)

# 4. Winner
if(action_B == "Fold") result <- "A wins"
if(action_B == "Call"){if(card_A >  card_B) result <- "A wins"
                       if(card_A <  card_B) result <- "B wins"
                       if(card_A == card_B) result <- "draw"}

# 5. Gain/loss
if(result == "draw"  ) gain <- 0
if(result == "A wins") gain <- pot/2
if(result == "B wins") gain <- pot/2
  
# Summary
print(paste("Player A receives a", card_A, "and bets", bet_A,
            ". Player B receives a", card_B, "and decides to", action_B))
print(paste("The pot is", pot, "and the result of the hand is:", result))
```
